Branches: 
Master [This is for Release Code ONLY]
Develop [Branched from Master.  This is for QA-ready code, and is the first branch/location where developers will combine their code bases]
yourName [Branched from Develop.  This is your personal branch, you can do whatever you want with it, but it is recommended that you use this in order to split in to multiple branches for ease of developing multiple features. Example branches are yourNameFeatureOne and yourNameFeatureTwo, where they both branch from yourName.]
